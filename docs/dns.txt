		   DNS
--------------------------


This doc is about DNS and how they work, and how to find DNS misconfigurations.

DNS are naming systems for computers used to convert human readable domain names into computer readable IP-addresses.

For example, when we go on and open a browser tab, type google.com, it's now the responsibilty of the DNS resolver, laying at
our OS, to get the IP-address of the domain name.

It first checks it's local cache for a record of the queried domain name. It then queried the DNS server to see if it 
has the record if the record is not found in the cache. If the IP-address was not found, it then starts to query nameservers 
recursively until the IP-address is found, then caches it for future use.

Resource Records and the Zone file
----------------------------------

The Zone file is basically a text file present on the server hosting the domain. It contains entries for different resource records.

Each Zone file must start with a SOA (Start Of Authority) record containing an authoritative nameserver for the domain, and an email
address of someone responsible for the management of the nameserver.

Different types of Resource Records exist within a Zone file, some of the most important ones are:

- A Records: A Records map an IP-address to a hostname.

- NS Records: NS Records delegate a given zone to use the given authoritative nameserver.
	For example, ns1.google.com is an authoritative nameserver for google.com.

- MX Records: MX Records tell us which servers are responsible for receiving emails sent to the domain name.

- TXT Records: TXT Records contain arbitrary human readable text in a record.

- CNAME Records: CNAME Records give an alias of some name to another.
	For example: www.google.com to google.com.

		dig
-------------------

dig stands for Domain Information Groper, this tool is used to query DNS nameservers.

The output of a simple dig command (dig google.com for example), consists of the following:

- Header: Shows the dig tool's version number, along with some global options used by dig, and some header information.

- QUESTION SECTION: This shows the question part of the whole operation, which is our input. It will show the A record in the case of google.com
as it's the default behaviour of the dig tool.

- ANSWER SECTION: This is the actual output of the command, shows the A record of google.com in this case.

- AUTHORITY SECTION: Displays the available nameservers of the target, the nameservers that have the authority to reply to queries.

- ADDITIONAL SECTION: Shows the IP-addresses of the authoritative nameservers.

- Stats section: Shows some statistics about the command.

The use of the dig tool is pretty simple, just type dig and the records type/all , and use the -x flag if a reverse dns lookup is needed.
