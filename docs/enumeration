Unicornscan is an information gathering and correlation engine tool.
	It is useful for introducing stimulus and measuring the response from a TCP/IP device.

Unicorn has the following features:

	- Asynchronous stateless TCP port scanning.

	- Asynchronous stateless TCP banner grabbing.

	- Asynchronous UDP port scanning.

	- Active and passive remote OS and application identification.

The main difference between Unicornscan and other similar tools is that it is a very fast an scalable port scanner.
	UDP port scanning usually takes a long time to finish, but Unicornscan can help with this problem.
	In Unicornscan, we can define how many packets we want to send per second.
	The higher the Packets Per Second (PPS) value, the faster the scan process; but this may cause
	a network congestion, so be careful when using this capability.
	The default PPS is 300.

-m [mode] = Select scan mode.

-Iv = Display the results immediately, and be verbose.

-r [number] = Set the PPS to [number].
