| Unicornscan |
===============

Unicornscan is an information gathering and correlation engine tool.
	It is useful for introducing stimulus and measuring the response from a TCP/IP device.

Unicorn has the following features:

	- Asynchronous stateless TCP port scanning.

	- Asynchronous stateless TCP banner grabbing.

	- Asynchronous UDP port scanning.

	- Active and passive remote OS and application identification.

The main difference between Unicornscan and other similar tools is that it is a very fast an scalable port scanner.
	UDP port scanning usually takes a long time to finish, but Unicornscan can help with this problem.
	In Unicornscan, we can define how many packets we want to send per second.
	The higher the Packets Per Second (PPS) value, the faster the scan process; but this may cause
	a network congestion, so be careful when using this capability.
	The default PPS is 300.

-m [mode] = Select scan mode.

-Iv = Display the results immediately, and be verbose.

-r [number] = Set the PPS to [number].

| Amap |
========

Amap is a tool that can be used to check the application running on a specific port.
	It works by sending a trigger packet to the port and comparing the response with it's database.

-b = Banner grabbing mode.
-q = Do not report closed or unidentified ports.

| SMB Enumeration |
===================

If you are testing a Windows machine, the easiest way to collect information about the enviroment is by using
	a Server Message Block (SMB) enumeration tool such as 'nbtscan'.

Nbtscan is used to produce a report containing the IP address, MAC address, NetBIOS computer name, 
services available, and username of the corresponding Windows machine.

To specify a range of hosts: nbtscan 192.168.0.1-254

Use the '-hv' flags for human readable, verbose output.

| SNMP Enumeration |
====================

Even though the information from a Simple Network Monitoring Protocol (SNMP) device may not look important,
	an attacker may encounter misconfigurations that can allow him to read the configuration, get important
	information, and even have a privilege to modify the configuration.

Some of the SNMP scanners follow:

	- OneSixtyOne
		The onesixtyone tool can be used as an SNMP scanner to find whether the SNMP community string exists on
			a device. The difference with respect to other SNMP scanners is that this tool sends all the 
			SNMP requests as fast as it can (10 ms apart). Then it waits for the responses and logs them.
			If the device is available, it will send responses containing the SNMP string.

		Sample usage: onesixtyone -d 192.168.0.3
		The '-d' flag is for more verbose output.

	- Snmpcheck
		We can use snmpcheck to collect more information about the SNMP device using
		the following command:
		snmpcheck -t 192.168.0.3

| VPN Enumeration |
===================

Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) can be devided into at least three groups:

	- IPsec-based VPN.

	- OpenVPN.

	- SSL-based VPN.

There're tools out there test VPN, some follow:

	- ike-scan
		The ike-scan tool os a security tool that can be used to discover, fingerprint,
		and test IPsec VPN systems. IPsec is the most commonly used technology for LAN-to-LAN
		and remote access VPN solutions.

	IPsec uses three major protocols as follows:
		- Authentication Headers (AH): Provides data integrity.

		- Encapsulation Security Payloads (ESP):
			Provides data integrity and confidentiality.

		- Internet Key Exchange (IKE): This provides support
			for the negotiation of parameters between endpoints; it establishes,
			maintains, and terminates the Security Association (SA).

	IKE establishes security association through the following phases:

 		- IKE phase 1: This sets up a secure channel between two IPsec endpoints by
			the negotiation of parameters, such as the encryption algorithm, integrity
			algorithm, authentication type, key distribution mechanism, and lifetime. To
			establish the bidirectional security association, IKE phase 1 can either use the
			main mode or aggressive mode. The main mode negotiates SA through three
			pairs of messages, while the aggressive mode provides faster operations
			through the exchange of three messages.

 		- IKE phase 2: This is used for data protection.

 		- IKE phase 1.5 or the extended authentication phase: This is an optional
			phase and is commonly used in the remote access VPN solutions.

	The ike-scan tool works by sending IKE phase 1 packets to the VPN servers and
		displaying any responses it receives.

	The following are several features of ike-scan:

 		- Ability to send the IKE packets to any number of destination hosts.

 		- Ability to construct the outgoing IKE packets in a flexible way.

 		- Ability to decode and display any response packets.

 		- Ability to crack the aggressive mode pre-shared keys with the help of the psk-crack tool.

	In short, the ike-scan tool is capable of two things:

		- Discovery: Finding hosts running the IKE by displaying the hosts that
			respond to the IKE request.

		- Fingerprint: Identifying the IKE implementation used by the IPsec VPN
			server. Usually, this information contains the VPN vendor and the model of
			the VPN server. This is useful for later use in the vulnerability analysis process.

	The reason why you need a tool like ike-scan is that in general, port scanner will
	not be able to find an IPsec VPN server because these servers don't listen on any
	TCP ports. And, they also don't send ICMP unreachable error message, so UDP
	scans will not find them either. Also, if you try to send random garbage data to the
	UDP port 500 or IP protocols 50 and 51, you will not receive any response. So, the
	only way to find the IPsec VPN server is by using a tool that can send a correctly
	formatted IKE packet and display any responses that are received from that server.	

	To discover, fingerprint and test an IPsec VPN server, use the following command:

	ike-scan -M -A -P [filename] [IP]

	Where '-M' means a splitted decoded payload, for easier reading, '-A' is to use the IKE 
	aggressive mode, and '-P' saves the pre-shared key to the desired file.

	The next step is to use a dictionary attack to crack the password using the
	'psk-crack' tool as follows:

	psk-crack -d [wordlist] [pre-shared key file]
