// Looks for the A, AAAA, and MX records of a domain automatically.
// Use -a to query for any records.
// If the domain name is supplied to host, the method is called forward lookup.
// If the IP address is supplied to host, the method is called reverse lookup.

- dnsenum [URL]
// Finds the IP address, DNS server, and MX records of a host.
// Can find additional names and subdomains using Google Search (Use with the -p flag for the number of Google pages,
// or with -s to define number of subdomains to collect).
// Can brute-force subdomains from text files, dns.txt which has 1480 records,
// and dns-big.txt that has 266930 records (Use with the -f flag).
// Can carry out 'whois' queries on C-class domain network ranges and calculate it's network ranges.
// Can carry out reverse lookup on network ranges.
// Can use threads to speed up query processing (Use with the --threads flag).

// Can find subdomains of a target domain (Using the -s flag).
// Can find the email address of a target domain (Using the -e flag).
// Can find open/filtered/closed ports on a machine using port scan (Using the -p flag).
// Use the -b flag to grab banners.
// Use the -f flag to show filtered ports.

- tcptraceroute
// A better alternative to the regular tracroute command, use TCP SYN packets instead of regular ICMO/UDP packets.

- tctrace
// Uses TCP SYN packets to do route analysis.
// Use the -i flag to set the interface, and the -d flag to set the IP/URL.

- theharvester
// An email accounts, username, and hostname/subdomains gathering tool.
// Uses public resources and search engines such as Google, Google profiles, Bing, PGP, LinedIn, Yandex, and others.
// Supply the host to be scanned with the -d flag, limit the results with the -l flag.
// Supply the resource to be used with the -b flag.

- metagoofil

// Specify the file-types to search for with the -t flag (Comma separated).
// Specify the target domain using the -d flag.
// Specify the saving directory using the -o flag.
// Specify the limit for each file-type using the -l flag.
// Specify the download limit for each file-type using the -n flag.
// Specify the file to save the generated report with the -f flag.
