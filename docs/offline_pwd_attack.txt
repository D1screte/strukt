================================

Hash-identifier
===============
This tool can be used to identify a password hash type.
Before we are can crack a password hash, we need to determine it's type in order to 
give the correct algorithm for the password cracker.

Type 'hash-id' in the terminal to run the tool.

Hashcat
=======
Hashcat is a free multithreaded password-cracking tool.
Currently, it can be used to crack more than 80 algorithms,
for more info visit http://hashcat.net/hashcat/#features-algos.
Hash cat is a CPU-based password cracker; it's slower than GPU-based password crackers.

Hashcat supports six attack modes which are:

	- Straight: Also known as Dictionary Attacks, this type of attacks 
	simply uses every line from a given wordlist as the password candidate.

	- Combination: Hashcat will combine each word in the dictionary.
	For example, if we have 'abc' and '123' as dictionary words,
	Hashcat will create 'abc123', 'abcabc', '123abc', and '123123' as password candidates.

	- Toggle case: Hashcat will generate all the possible combinations of upper and
	lowercase variants of each word of the dictionary.

	- Brute force: Hashcat will try all combinations from a keyspace.
	This attack mode is being replaced by the mask attack.
	For example, if we specify the password candidates of two-charachter
	length and charset A-Z, Hashcat will generate password candidates from
	AA to ZZ.

	- Permutation: Hashcat will create all permutations of the word.
	For example, in the dictionary, we have AB as a word.
	The permutations of this are AB and BA.

	- Table-lookup: For each word of the dictionary, Hashcat automatically
	generates masks.
	For example, if we have the word 'word' in the wordlist,
	the outputs would be word, w0rd, wOrd, and w.rd.

RainbowCrack
============
RainbowCrack is a tool that can be used to crack a password hash using rainbow tables.
It works by implementing the time-memory tradoff techniquie developed by Philippe Oechslin.
There're 3 RainbowCrack tools that must be run in sequence to make things work:
	
	- rtgen: This tool is used to generate the rainbow tables.
	Sometimes, this process is called the precomputation stage.
	The rainbow tables contain plaintext, hash, hash algorithm, charset,
	and plaintext length range.
	The precomputation is a time-consuming process, but once the precomputation
	is finished, the password cracker tool will have a much faster performance 
	compared to the brute-force cracker.
	The rtgen tool supports LanMan, NTLM, MD2, MD4, MD5, SHA1, and RIPEMD160 has algorithms.

	- rtsort: This tool is used to sort the rainbow tables generated by rtgen.

	- rcrack: This tool is used to look up the rainbow tables to find the hash.

John The Ripper
===============
John The Ripper is a tool that can be used to crack password hashes.
Currently, it can crack more than 40 password hash types, including
DES, MD5, LM, NT, crypt, NETLM, and NETNTLM.
One of the reasons why we should use John instead of other password
cracking tools is that John is able to work with the DES and crypt algorithms.

John supports four password cracking modes:

	- Wordlist mode: Specify the wordlist to be used using the
	--wordlist=/path/to/wordlist

	- Single crack mode: This mode uses login names, Full Name
	field, and user's home directory as password candidates.
	These candidates are then used to crack the password of the account
	it was taken from or to crack the password hash with the same salt.

	- Incremental mode: This is another name for the Brute-force method.
	Assign the incremental mode in the configuration file of John.
	The predefined modes are All, Allnum, Alpha, Digits, and Lanman,
	you can also define your own mode.

	- External mode: Read more about this mode at

Crunch
======
Crunch is a tool used to create wordlists based on user criteria.
This wordlist is then used during the password-cracking process.
