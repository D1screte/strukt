When performing a port scanning on a TCP port using a SYN packet on the target machine,
the attacker might face on of the following behaviors :

- The target machine responds with a SYN+ACK packet, which means the port is open.
- The target machine responds with a RST+ACK packet, which means the port is closed.
- The target reponds with an ICMP message such as 'ICMP Port Unreachable',
which means that the port isn't accessible to the attacker, most like because
of the existence of a blocking firewall.
- The target doesn't respond at all, which means that there's no network serivce listening
on that port, or a firewall is blocking our SYN packet silently.

During a port scanning activity to a UDP port on the target machine,
an attacker might face one of the following behaviors :

- The target machine responds with a UDP packet, which indicates that the port is open.
- The target machine responds with an ICMP message such as 'ICMP Port Unreachable',
which means that the port is closed, if the message received is not an ICMP unreachable,
it means that the port is filtered by a firewall.
- The target doesn't respond at all, which may indicate one of the following :
	1 - The port is closed.
	2 - The inbound UDP packet is blocked.
	3 - The response is blocked.
