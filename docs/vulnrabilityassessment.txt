| Cisco analysis |
==================

Cisco products are of the top networking devices found in major corporate and government organizations today.
	We will discuss some Cisco-related security tools in this section as follows:

	- Cisco Auditing Tool
		Cisco Auditing Tool (CAT) is a mini security auditing tool. It scans the Cisco routers
			for common vulnerabilities such as default passwords, SNMP community strings, and
			some old IOS bugs.

		Possible options to be used are '-h' which is used to specify the target host, -w to specify the
		wordlist for community name guessing, -a to specify the wordlist for password guessing, and -i to check
		for IOS bugs. 

	- Cisco Global Exploiter
		Cisco Global Exploiter (CGE) is a small Perl script that combines 14 individual vulnerabilities
			that can be tested against the Cisco devices.

		An example command may look like:

		cge.pl [IP] [vuln_num]
